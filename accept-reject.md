title: When to accept or reject
---

The purpose of rejecting documents is to focus the annotations on full texts. 
Reject when
- the text consists of short list items (e.g. product listings on a web shop page, lists of links)
- the main body of text are short photo captions
- the sentences donâ€™t form a coherent text
- there are only individual lines of actual text 
- the amount of coherent text is very small compared to the 'junk' text
- there are no complete sentences, or fewer than two (e.g. lists of short news introductions)
- the text is not in the target language
- the text is poorly extracted (not representative of the web page)
- the document consists of special characters or numbers only
