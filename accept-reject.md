title: When to accept or reject
---

The purpose of rejecting documents is to focus the annotations on full texts. 
Reject when
- the text consists of short list items (e.g. product listings on a web shop page, lists of links)
- the sentences donâ€™t form a coherent text
- there are only individual lines of actual text
- there are no complete sentences, or fewer than two (e.g. lists of short news introductions)
- the text is entirely in a foreign language or otherwise incomprehensible
- the document consists of special characters or numbers only
