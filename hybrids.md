title: When to give a document several labels
---

A text should be given two registers when it features characteristics of more than one register. 

E.g. when
- a personal blog includes a recipe: Narrative blog + Recipe
- a text describing something also includes instructions: Description of a thing or person + Other how-to
- a marketing text is followed by reviews: Description with intent to sell + Review
- a sport report includes the writer's viewpoints: Sports report + Other opinion
- a blog post that informs the reader about an upcoming football match and invites them to watch: Narrative blog + Other informational persuasion
- Eulogy with lyrics and decriptions: Lyrics + Other narrative
- See Biber & Egbert 2018: 200

Please note that Encyclopedia articles, like Wikipedia texts, are not by default hybrids.
