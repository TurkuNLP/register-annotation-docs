title: When to label text as hybrid
---

A text should be given two registers when it features characteristics of more than one register. 

E.g. when
- a personal blog includes a recipe: Narrative blog + Recipe
- a text describing something also includes instructions: Description of a thing or person + Other how-to
- a marketing text is followed by reviews: Description with intent to sell + Review
- a sport report includes the writer's viewpoints: Sports report + Other opinion
- See Biber & Egbert 2018: 200

Please note that Encyclopedia articles, like Wikipedia texts, are not by default hybrids.
